### Nice to Meet you! ðŸ‘‹

## My name is Hyeongmeen Baik, and feel free to call me Baik or Hyeongmeen!

I'm an undergraduate student at Yonsei University, majoring in Electrical & Electronic Engineering ðŸš€  
I am interested in power systems, power electronics, electric machines, and electric drives.  
For the past year, I have worked on the x-y displacement and rotary position sensor system based on linear Hall-effect sensors.
Also, I investigated the improved performance of a photovoltaic power output forecasting model based on an Artificial Neural Network compared to conventional ML models.

You can find my current works in my repositories. Feel free to navigate!

I enjoy playing basketball and soccer, listening to music, and playing instruments. ðŸ˜€  
I want to develop every beautiful thing. âœ¨
