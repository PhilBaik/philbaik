### Nice to Meet you! ðŸ‘‹

#### My name is Hyeongmeen Baik, You call me Baik or Hyeongmeen!

I'm an undergraduate student at Yonsei University, majoring in Electrical & Electronic Engineering ðŸš€  
I am interested in power systems, power electronics, electric machines, and electric drives.  
For the past year, I have worked on the x-y displacement and rotary position sensor system based on linear Hall-effect sensors.
Also, I investigated the improved performance of a photovoltaic power output forecasting model based on an Artificial Neural Network compared to conventional ML models.

You can find my current works in my repositories. Feel free to navigate!

I enjoy playing basketball and soccer, listening to music, and playing instruments. ðŸ˜€  
I want to develop every beautiful thing. âœ¨

### Current works
#### Y. Kang, D. Laborda, H. Baik, D. Fernandez, D. Regiosa, F. Briz, "Magnetic Resolver using Linear Hall-Effect Sensors"
Precise measurement/estimation of rotary position is essential for the control of AC electric machines. 
Accurate measurement of angular position in industry applications is typically accomplished using encoder and resolvers. 
Variable reluctance (VR) resolvers are a well-suited option because of their inherent robustness in harsh environments; 
however, they occupy a substantial percentage of the total drive cost. 
This paper presents a novel magnetic resolver using low-cost linear Hall-effect sensors. 
A series of design optimization processes proposed a corresponding prototype evaluated both by finite element analysis (FEA) and subsequent experiments. 
Two alternative mechanical designs are discussed: shaft and in-shaft types. 
The proposed magnetic resolver possesses the advantages of conventional encoders including compactness and a reduced manufacturing costs, while maintaining the advantages of VR resolvers. Also, the sensor is fully compatible with conventional drives in electrical terms
   
#### H. Baik, Y. Kang, D. Fernandez, "Hall sensor based Transnational and Rotary Position Sensing System"
This paper presents a new methodology to determine both rotary and translational positions required for a mag- netic levitation system and robot joint. 
Permanent magnets are mounted on the moving part while the low-cost hall-effect sensors are measuring radial direction magnetic flux on the stationary part. 
Hall sensors are strategically placed to enable use of differ- ential information. 
The radial flux are post-processed for position estimation without filter; 
only addition and multiplication opera- tions are required. Vertical and horizontal position displacement induced zero-sequences from Clarkâ€™ transformation are used; differential information enables translational and rotary position estimation. 
The manufactured sensorâ€™s rotary position range is 0 to 2Ï€ and the translation position range is within 1mm in both x- and y-axes from the center position. 
The proposed sensing system is a low-cost, compact in size.
